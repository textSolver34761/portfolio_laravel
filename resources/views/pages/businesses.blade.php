    <h1 class="text-center">Online Business</h1> <br>
        <h2 class="text-center"> I am planning on making at least two online businesses. <br> If you want to know why and how, you are on the right place! </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            My online business would have 2 objectives:
            <ul>
                <li>To show what I am technicaly capable; </li>
                <li>To show what I have learned form my management school (ISC Paris). </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h1 class="text-center">My first business idea would be a shop.</h1> <br>
            I want to try out new thing.<br>
            I have heard of the 3D printer. There was one at Simplon, but I didn't totally wasn't sure how to make good use of it. <br>
            I think this tool can help me design, create and sell jewelry... It is still an idea, but I like it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <h1 class="text-center">My secound business idea would be to create an app.</h1> <br>
            I really want to try out new thing. <br>
            I have notions in Android, but it will not help if I want to put my app available on the Apple Store (Apple) and the Play Store (Android)  <br>
            To do that, I'm willing to train myself in React Native... Like the first business, is still an idea
        </p>

        <p>
            If I start thoses (at least one of them), you'll be able to found the <a href="accountancy"> accountancy </a> of the business I have started.<br>
