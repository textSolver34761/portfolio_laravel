            <h3 class="text-center"> Why this site?</h3> 
            This site has two objectives : 
            <ul>
                <li>To show what I have learned; </li>
                <li>To show where I want to go; </li>
            </ul>
            As you can see in the <a href="work"> work </a> tab, and thanks to my training at <a href="https://simplon.co"> Simplon </a> I am specialized in PHP. This means that know how to code in native PHP, in Laravel, and i'm willing to learn Symfony. <br>
            As I said to my trainers on my first week I started coding it's that I'd like to go on AI (Artificial Intelligence) or on IoT (Internet Of Things). <br>
            The best way for me to start this was to build a chatbot (you can find it <a href="https://landbot.io/u/H-27113-GJVK3FFB9B71354C/index.html"> here. </a>)
        </p>

        <p>
            Before starting coding, I have work for almost two years at CSC (witch became DXC Technoloy thanks to its merge with HP Enteprise) and EI-Technologies who are both consulting compagnies. <br>
            I was a functional Salesforce consultant and I learned:
            <ul>
                <li> how to apdat myself to new project; </li>
                <li> how to work in team. I have worked with a group of more than ten poeple (including functionals consultants, technical consutlant, managers) on few projects; </li>
                <li> how to use the Agile method. I reinforced this skill while training myself at Simplon, with the Scrum Master and Product Owner roles.</li>
                <li>  </li>
            </ul>
            And I'm still willing to learn more. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Before being a Salesforce consultant I was graduated from <a href="https://www.iscparis.com/"> ISC School of Management </a> in Marketing Digital & E-Business, so I can easly make the connection between the customer and the developer team i'll be working with.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite coding, I like reading spirital books and meditating. <br>
